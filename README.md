# (Ignite + NativeBase) Experiment

A useful CLI for React Native, boilerplates, plugins, generators, and more.

 - https://github.com/infinitered/ignite

 - https://infinite.red/ignite

Make sure we have Node 7.6+

```
mkdir ignite && cd ignite

nvm install 7.6.0

nvm use 7.6.0
```

```
node -v && npm -v

v7.6.0
4.1.2
```

## Install Ignite CLI

### Install yarn

Beacuse we use nvm, we should exclude installing Node.js so that nvmâ€™s version of Node.js is used.

- https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/

```
brew install yarn --without-node
```

```
yarn --version

1.3.2
```

### Install react-native-cli

```
npm i -g react-native-cli
```

### Now install ignite-cli

```
npm install -g ignite-cli
```

## Project Structure

 - https://github.com/infinitered/ignite/blob/master/docs/quick-start/project-structure.md


## How to create a new (Ignite + NativeBase) project

```
ignite new appname --boilerplate native-base-boilerplate
```

### Boilerplate

 - https://github.com/GeekyAnts/ignite-native-base-boilerplate

#### Generators

```
ignite generate screen MyNewScreen
```

```
ignite generate container MyNewContainer
```

This generates a generic components which is reusable in any screen of the app.

```
ignite generate component MyNewComponent
```

Floatlist, Row, Single

```
ignite generate list MyNewList
```

## Create a new (Ignite + NativeBase) project

```
brew install watchman
```

```
ignite new cryptofak --boilerplate native-base-boilerplate
```

```
ðŸ”¥ igniting app cryptofak
âœ” using the Native Base's Iginte boilerplate v2

âœ” added React Native 0.47.2 in 47.46s

? What internationalization library will you use?

âœ” added ignite-native-base-boilerplate in 45.74s
âœ” added ignite-vector-icons in 29.24s
âœ” added ignite-standard in 34.17s

âœ” configured git
```

### To get started:

```
cd cryptofak

react-native run-ios
react-native run-android
```

If you hit the error:

```
xcrun: error: unable to find utility "instruments", not a developer
tool or in PATH
```

Set the Xcode path:

```
sudo xcode-select -s /Applications/Xcode.app
```

### To run in Android

Before using Ignite make sure we've followed the latest react-native setup instructions at:

 - https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html

#  cryptofak
[![js-standard-style](https://img.shields.io/badge/code%20style-standard-brightgreen.svg?style=flat)](http://standardjs.com/)

* Standard compliant React Native App Utilizing [Ignite](https://github.com/infinitered/ignite)

## :arrow_up: How to Setup

**Step 1:** git clone this repo:

**Step 2:** cd to the cloned repo:

**Step 3:** Install the Application with `yarn` or `npm i`


## :arrow_forward: How to Run App

1. cd to the repo
2. Run Build for either OS
  * for iOS
    * run `react-native run-ios`
  * for Android
    * Run Genymotion
    * run `react-native run-android`

## :no_entry_sign: Standard Compliant

[![js-standard-style](https://cdn.rawgit.com/feross/standard/master/badge.svg)](https://github.com/feross/standard)
This project adheres to Standard.  Our CI enforces this, so we suggest you enable linting to keep your project compliant during development.

**To Lint on Commit**

This is implemented using [husky](https://github.com/typicode/husky). There is no additional setup needed.

**Bypass Lint**

If you have to bypass lint for a special commit that you will come back and clean (pushing something to a branch etc.) then you can bypass git hooks with adding `--no-verify` to your commit command.

**Understanding Linting Errors**

The linting rules are from JS Standard and React-Standard.  [Regular JS errors can be found with descriptions here](http://eslint.org/docs/rules/), while [React errors and descriptions can be found here](https://github.com/yannickcr/eslint-plugin-react).

## :closed_lock_with_key: Secrets

This project uses [react-native-config](https://github.com/luggit/react-native-config) to expose config variables to your javascript code in React Native. You can store API keys
and other sensitive information in a `.env` file:

```
API_URL=https://myapi.com
GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=abcdefgh
```

and access them from React Native like so:

```
import Secrets from 'react-native-config'

Secrets.API_URL  // 'https://myapi.com'
Secrets.GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY  // 'abcdefgh'
```

The `.env` file is ignored by git keeping those secrets out of your repo.
